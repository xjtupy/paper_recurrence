The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes, which granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy.","spans":[[0,8],[9,16],[17,23],[24,28],[29,31],[32,41],[42,45],[46,53],[54,56],[57,61],[61,62],[63,75],[76,82],[83,85],[86,89],[90,98],[99,102],[103,110],[111,116],[117,119],[120,126],[126,127],[128,133],[134,137],[137,138],[138,144],[145,148],[149,155],[156,158],[159,165],[166,175],[175,176],[177,179],[180,189],[190,196],[197,206],[207,210],[211,215],[216,222],[223,232],[233,238],[239,244],[244,245],[246,254],[255,264],[265,269],[269,270],[271,273],[274,279],[280,282],[283,295],[296,303],[304,313],[314,325],[326,329],[330,336],[337,339],[340,350],[351,355],[356,359],[360,366],[367,372],[372,373],[374,375],[376,382],[383,385],[386,395],[396,405],[406,414],[414,415],[416,421],[422,424],[425,428],[429,433],[434,436],[437,445],[445,446],[447,453],[454,468],[469,473],[474,478],[479,481],[482,486],[486,487],[488,491],[492,496],[497,504],[505,510],[511,515],[516,519],[520,528],[529,531],[532,535],[536,541],[542,544],[545,551],[551,552],[553,558],[559,566],[567,570],[571,580],[581,592],[593,602],[602,603],[604,613],[614,617],[618,626],[627,635],[635,636]],"answers":["granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy","granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy","granted the Huguenots substantial religious, political and military autonomy"],"uuid":"57105da9a58dae1900cd69a2"},"81":{"context":"Steam engines are external combustion engines, where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products.

Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W.

The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College.","spans":[[0,11],[12,22],[23,25],[26,29],[30,43],[44,55],[56,59],[60,64],[65,75],[76,81],[82,85],[86,90],[91,98],[99,100],[100,103],[104,109],[110,120],[120,121],[121,122],[123,130],[131,133],[134,137],[138,144],[145,151],[151,152],[153,159],[160,171],[172,174],[175,181],[182,190],[190,191],[192,195],[196,199],[200,207],[208,219],[220,221],[221,229],[229,230],[231,234],[235,244],[245,248],[249,256],[257,259],[260,267],[268,275],[275,276],[277,279],[280,283],[284,289],[290,299],[300,311],[311,312],[313,321],[322,327],[328,336],[337,347],[348,352],[353,356],[357,369],[369,370],[371,374],[375,380],[381,388],[389,398],[399,406],[407,424],[425,428],[429,438],[439,445],[445,446],[447,450],[451,461],[462,465],[466,473],[474,478],[479,483],[484,493],[494,505],[506,512],[513,516],[517,521],[522,529],[529,530],[531,534],[535,537],[538,541],[542,546],[547,554],[555,562],[563,566],[567,574],[575,577],[578,581],[582,589],[590,598],[599,612],[613,618],[619,625],[626,632],[632,633],[634,643],[644,647],[648,656],[657,662],[663,666],[666,667],[668,677],[678,685],[686,688],[689,694],[694,696],[697,701],[702,708],[709,710],[710,719],[719,720],[721,732],[733,736],[737,744],[745,748],[749,759],[760,772],[773,780],[781,785],[786,787],[788,794],[795,803],[804,814],[814,815],[816,823],[824,827],[828,829],[830,838],[839,845],[846,848],[849,852],[853,864],[865,867],[868,876],[877,889],[890,892],[893,897],[897,898],[899,904],[905,911],[912,918],[919,922],[923,926],[927,937],[938,945],[946,949],[950,955],[956,966],[967,970],[971,976],[977,980],[981,983],[984,987],[988,993],[994,996],[997,1003],[1004,1007],[1008,1018],[1019,1022],[1023,1033],[1034,1044],[1045,1050],[1051,1054],[1055,1058],[1058,1059],[1060,1063],[1064,1077],[1078,1085],[1086,1092],[1093,1106],[1107,1112],[1113,1116],[1117,1121],[1122,1128],[1129,1133],[1134,1143],[1144,1151],[1151,1152]],"answers":["Charles W.

The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are

study by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the

The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900.

by the World Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the

for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the

Institute for Development Economics Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a

A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\"","spans":[[0,1],[2,7],[8,10],[11,14],[15,20],[21,30],[31,34],[35,46],[47,56],[57,65],[66,68],[69,75],[76,83],[84,94],[95,102],[103,107],[108,111],[112,119],[120,121],[121,122],[123,125],[126,132],[133,138],[139,144],[145,147],[147,148],[149,151],[152,158],[159,165],[166,168],[169,172],[173,177],[178,182],[182,183],[184,187],[188,193],[194,201],[202,208],[209,211],[212,215],[216,221],[222,229],[230,234],[235,244],[245,251],[252,256],[257,260],[261,267],[268,270],[271,278],[279,287],[287,288],[289,292],[293,301],[302,308],[309,311],[312,315],[316,317],[317,319],[320,327],[328,334],[335,347],[347,348],[349,353],[354,356],[357,363],[364,365],[365,367],[368,376],[377,379],[380,384],[384,385],[386,387],[388,395],[396,400],[401,407],[408,410],[411,416],[417,423],[424,428],[429,432],[433,435],[436,446],[447,458],[459,461],[462,465],[466,471],[472,476],[477,478],[479,487],[488,494],[495,500],[501,503],[504,508],[509,511],[512,515],[516,522],[523,525],[525,526],[527,529],[530,533],[534,539],[539,541],[542,552],[552,553],[554,556],[557,562],[563,566],[567,574],[575,581],[581,582],[583,592],[593,595],[596,597],[598,601],[602,609],[610,615],[616,624],[625,627],[628,631],[632,638],[638,639],[640,643],[644,654],[655,656],[656,657],[658,662],[663,665],[665,666],[667,669],[670,673],[674,679],[679,681],[682,688],[688,689],[690,693],[694,696],[697,704],[705,711],[711,712],[713,714],[715,720],[721,725],[726,728],[729,732],[733,743],[744,745],[745,746],[746,747],[748,751],[752,757],[758,761],[761,762],[763,765],[766,769],[770,775],[776,786],[786,788],[789,795],[795,796],[797,802],[803,805],[806,809],[810,814],[815,817],[818,821],[822,828],[829,833],[834,836],[837,840],[841,851],[851,852],[853,857],[858,866],[866,867],[868,870],[871,878],[879,883],[883,884],[885,890],[891,899],[900,904],[905,908],[909,919],[920,921],[922,929],[930,934],[935,938],[939,943],[944,948],[949,953],[954,956],[957,960],[961,967],[968,974],[975,977],[978,982],[982,983],[984,986],[987,994],[995,999],[1000,1005],[1006,1008],[1009,1015],[1016,1022],[1023,1027],[1028,1034],[1035,1039],[1040,1043],[1044,1047],[1048,1049],[1049,1050],[1051,1054],[1055,1058],[1059,1065],[1066,1070],[1071,1073],[1074,1077],[1078,1083],[1083,1085],[1086,1092],[1093,1096],[1097,1101],[1102,1105],[1106,1118],[1119,1128],[1129,1134],[1135,1142],[1143,1144],[1145,1154],[1154,1155],[1156,1158],[1159,1166],[1167,1171],[1171,1172],[1173,1179],[1180,1186],[1187,1196],[1197,1198],[1199,1204],[1205,1210],[1211,1216],[1217,1223],[1224,1234],[1235,1244],[1245,1247],[1248,1256],[1256,1257],[1258,1261],[1262,1266],[1267,1271],[1272,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1284],[1284,1286],[1287,1293],[1294,1296],[1297,1300],[1301,1303],[1304,1307],[1308,1313],[1314,1316],[1317,1322],[1323,1325],[1326,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1344],[1344,1345],[1346,1351],[1352,1358],[1359,1363],[1364,1370],[1371,1372],[1372,1379],[1379,1380],[1381,1382],[1383,1387],[1388,1394],[1395,1397],[1398,1403],[1404,1410],[1411,1415],[1416,1419],[1420,1422],[1423,1433],[1434,1445],[1446,1449],[1450,1452],[1453,1457],[1458,1464],[1465,1467],[1468,1471],[1472,1478],[1479,1483],[1484,1486],[1487,1490],[1491,1497],[1498,1508],[1509,1517],[1517,1518],[1519,1524],[1524,1526],[1527,1533],[1534,1538],[1539,1546],[1547,1551],[1552,1562],[1563,1565],[1566,1569],[1570,1575],[1576,1578],[1579,1582],[1583,1594],[1595,1599],[1599,1600],[1601,1603],[1604,1609],[1610,1613],[1614,1620],[1621,1622],[1622,1628],[1629,1631],[1632,1638],[1639,1642],[1643,1654],[1655,1660],[1660,1661],[1661,1662],[1663,1666],[1667,1672],[1673,1679],[1679,1680],[1681,1684],[1685,1693],[1693,1694],[1695,1700],[1701,1705],[1706,1711],[1712,1715],[1716,1720],[1721,1725],[1726,1732],[1733,1735],[1736,1739],[1740,1746],[1747,1753],[1754,1757],[1758,1765],[1766,1772],[1773,1777],[1778,1780],[1781,1786],[1787,1788],[1788,1791],[1792,1794],[1795,1796],[1797,1804],[1805,1813],[1814,1816],[1817,1821],[1822,1824],[1825,1843],[1844,1863],[1864,1870],[1870,1871],[1871,1872],[1873,1880],[1881,1890],[1890,1891],[1892,1895],[1896,1900],[1901,1907],[1908,1910],[1911,1914],[1915,1921],[1922,1928],[1929,1935],[1936,1941],[1942,1944],[1945,1948],[1949,1951],[1952,1955],[1956,1963],[1964,1966],[1967,1972],[1972,1974],[1975,1979],[1979,1980],[1981,1990],[1991,1994],[1995,2004],[2005,2010],[2011,2015],[2016,2018],[2019,2021],[2022,2023],[2024,2025],[2025,2030],[2031,2039],[2039,2040],[2041,2044],[2045,2046],[2046,2047],[2048,2051],[2051,2052],[2052,2057],[2058,2059],[2060,2061],[2062,2063],[2064,2065],[2066,2075],[2075,2076],[2076,2077]],"answers":["greater

The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 \u00b7 3, 1 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3.","spans":[[0,1],[2,7],[8,14],[15,16],[16,18],[19,20],[21,26],[26,27],[28,30],[31,32],[33,40],[41,47],[48,55],[56,60],[61,62],[63,67],[68,71],[72,74],[75,83],[84,92],[93,98],[99,103],[104,105],[106,109],[110,116],[116,117],[118,119],[120,127],[128,134],[135,142],[143,147],[148,149],[150,154],[155,157],[158,161],[162,163],[164,169],[170,176],[177,179],[180,186],[187,188],[189,198],[199,205],[205,206],[207,210],[211,218],[218,219],[220,221],[222,224],[225,230],[231,238],[239,240],[241,244],[245,246],[247,250],[251,254],[255,259],[260,268],[269,276],[277,284],[284,285],[286,293],[294,295],[296,298],[299,308],[309,316],[317,319],[320,323],[324,327],[328,336],[337,338],[339,342],[343,344],[345,347],[348,356],[357,359],[360,361],[362,365],[366,367],[367,368],[369,372],[373,384],[385,392],[393,395],[396,406],[407,418],[419,422],[423,430],[431,435],[436,438],[439,445],[446,448],[449,455],[456,462],[462,463],[464,467],[468,475],[476,483],[484,488],[489,490],[491,494],[495,497],[498,507],[508,510],[511,512],[513,520],[521,523],[524,530],[531,535],[536,538],[539,545],[546,548],[549,551],[552,560],[560,561],[562,565],[566,576],[577,579],[580,584],[585,592],[593,601],[602,611],[612,613],[614,616],[617,618],[619,624],[625,632],[633,636],[637,640],[641,648],[649,660],[661,665],[666,675],[676,678],[679,680],[681,683],[684,687],[688,701],[701,702],[703,707],[707,708],[709,710],[710,711],[712,713],[714,715],[716,717],[717,718],[719,720],[721,722],[723,724],[725,726],[727,728],[728,729],[730,733],[733,734],[735,738],[739,742],[743,748],[749,763],[764,766],[767,768],[768,769]],"answers":["a product of primes","product of primes that is unique up to ordering","primes","primes","primes that is unique up to ordering"],"uuid":"57296d571d04691400779416"},"291":{"context":"A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Its name originated from the Latin word \"imperium\", which means to rule over large territories. Imperialism is \"a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means\". Imperialism has greatly shaped the contemporary world. It has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas.

In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes non-obvious force of friction, and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion. A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity.
